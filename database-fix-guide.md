# Database Connection Fix Guide

## Problem Identified
- "Control plane request failed" error from Neon
- Database appears to be sleeping or has authentication issues
- Current DATABASE_URL format is correct but credentials may be invalid

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Fix Current Neon Database (Recommended)
1. Go to https://console.neon.tech
2. Find your database: `ep-falling-pine-a6yv1efa.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech`
3. Click "Connection Details"
4. Generate a new password or copy the current connection string
5. Update your Replit Secrets with the fresh DATABASE_URL

### Option 2: Create New Neon Database (If Option 1 fails)
1. In Neon dashboard, create a new database
2. Copy the new connection string
3. Update DATABASE_URL in Replit Secrets
4. Run `npm run db:push` to recreate tables

### Option 3: Temporary Development Mode
Use memory storage temporarily while fixing the database:

In `server/storage.ts`, temporarily switch to:
```javascript
import { MemStorage } from './memory-storage';
export const storage = new MemStorage();
```

## Current Environment Status
- PGHOST: ep-falling-pine-a6yv1efa.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech
- PGUSER: neondb_owner  
- PGDATABASE: neondb
- Connection: Failing with control plane error

## Next Steps After Fix
1. Test connection with recovery script
2. Run `npm run db:push` to sync schema
3. Import your 770 members if needed
4. Deploy to Vercel as planned

## Prevention
- Neon free tier databases auto-sleep after inactivity
- Keep credentials in sync between Neon dashboard and Replit secrets
- Consider upgrading to Neon Pro for production use
